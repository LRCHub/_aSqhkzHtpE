# DOES – A Cloudy Sky

Gray
Gray
The color of a cloudy day
On the wind I heard you call my name
On the wind I heard you call my name
On the wind I heard you call my name
On the wind I heard you

Gone, and everything I did wrong, it don't add up to this
Lost, and I measure the cost in years without a kiss
Entire lives I missed

Red
Red
I thought those old questions were dead
Every night I saw you close your eyes
Every night I saw you close your eyes
Every night I saw you close your eyes
Every night I saw you

Deep
Deep
I used to visit you in my sleep
Now I can never find you in my dreams
I can never find you in my dreams
I can never find you in my dreams
I can never find you in my dreams

I can never find you in my dreams
I can never find you in my dreams
I can never find you in my dreams
I can never find you
I can never find you
I can never find you
I can never find you
I can never find you
I can never find you
