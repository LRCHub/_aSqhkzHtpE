Uh, I'm from the city where them murders at
So hot could break a thermostat
People come and go and change, I swear I'm sick of learnin' that
Fuck up a good time 'cause this hot iron gon' burn his back
War vet', I served the 'Raq
Shoot a strap or serve a pack
Hustled early mornings, never go informant
Only time I sell out I'm performin'
We been earned our stripes, so that's a hundred bees swarmin'
Pushin' bags like doorman and leavin' niggas dormant, ah, yeah
Countin' cash, collectin' backends, it's all there
If they catch our brother lackin', we pallbearers
See the shit in they reactions, man, y'all scared
If they score, we want one back, then it's all fair
Switch'll make 'em fall quick, get close, make sure they all hit ya
I missed the gang, this big family turned into a small picture
Predicted I would beat the odds, that one lil' skinny tall nigga
Got everything I need from God, I made it, now I ball bigger
I got it out the mud, just don't put it on my name
Flown through the sky above, bitch, I do this for my gang
Fuck the jewelry and them chains, and the hoes and the fame
Through it all I'ma still be the same, uh, uh
I'ma still be that same nigga, man
I try to tell these people, like, I can't be nothin' less than great
Anything else, that's y'all opinion
On gang
A future Forbes List mogul, never let 'em control you
On business, standin' ten, bitch, I did what I'm 'posed to
And I told the bold truth, save you from my own troops
Feel like Clark Kent when he was spinnin' in that phone booth
Like, who gon' save our lives?
Thuggin' hard on our side, goin' hard for our tribe, and
Don't never count me out 'cause winnin' how this dark road ends
Can't never let them walls close in
