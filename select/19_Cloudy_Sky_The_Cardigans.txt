I'd catch some stars for you
And just for you
I'd paint the grey sky blue
And just for you
So don't tell me you want the rain
From a cloudy sky
To wash away the pain
That I've given you again
I've always tried to find
What satisfies your mind
But I will never know
Where you are to go
But I want you to know
Do you want a golden ring?
I would buy you anything...
I'd read some poems for you
Just for you
I hope they won't make you blue
Like they used to do
Don't tell me you want the rain
Don't tell me you want the rain
