Made of chrome
They celebrate
We just sleep
On holiday
And with their doubts
They crawl on me
Been on the phone
Since yesterday
And your face reveals the world
And all the things you could
have seen
It’s all the same,
you’re all insane
With the breeze comes the storm
Then you’ll all be washed away
It’s all the same,
you’re all insane
In a row
Stood separately
Under fire
But not for me
To this sound
Come roll with me
To our home
And made believe
And your face reveals the world
And all the things you could
have seen
It’s all the same,
you’re all insane
With the breeze comes the storm
Then you’ll all be washed away
It’s all the same,
you’re all insane
And all my wicked ways
You’re on your own again
I’m on my own again
And all my wicked ways
You’re on your own again
I’m on my own again
And your face reveals the world
And all the things you could
have seen
It’s all the same,
you’re all insane
With the breeze comes the storm
Then you’ll all be washed away
It’s all the same,
you’re all insane
And all my wicked ways
You’re on your own again
I’m on my own again
And all my wicked ways
You’re on your own again
I’m on my own again
